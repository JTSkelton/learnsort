- Visualize the code corresponding to each sorting algo
- Easy to use interface

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- React
- Javascript
- Figma

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Have a slow step by for each algo, along with descriptions
- Brief tutorial pop-ups
